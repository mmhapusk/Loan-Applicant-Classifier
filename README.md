# Loan-Applicant-Classifier
This is my final project for the IBM Machine Learning with Python course. This python notebook runs four classification models on loan applicant dataset, in order to accurately predict
whether an applicant has paid off his/her loan or in the process of collection. The four classification models run here are K-means, Decision Trees, Support Vector Machines and Logisitic Regression.
The final report consists of a compilation of accruacy scores for the models, primarily done using jaccard's index and f1-score.
